  abstract = {Missing data in time series is a pervasive problem that puts obstacles in the way of advanced analysis. A popular solution is imputation, where the fundamental challenge is to determine what values should be filled in. This paper proposes SAITS, a novel method based on the self-attention mechanism for missing value imputation in multivariate time series. Trained by a joint-optimization approach, SAITS learns missing values from a weighted combination of two diagonally-masked self-attention (DMSA) blocks. DMSA explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations between time steps, which improves imputation accuracy and training speed. Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign weights to the learned representations from two DMSA blocks according to the attention map and the missingness information. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and reveal SAITS’ potential to improve the learning performance of pattern recognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.}

    abstract = {With rising environmental concerns, accurate air quality predictions have become paramount as they help in planning preventive measures and policies for potential health hazards and environmental problems caused by poor air quality. Most of the time, air quality data are time series data. However, due to various reasons, we often encounter missing values in datasets collected during data preparation and aggregation steps. The inability to analyze and handle missing data will significantly hinder the data analysis process. To address this issue, this paper offers an extensive review of air quality prediction and missing data imputation techniques for time series, particularly in relation to environmental challenges. In addition, we empirically assess eight imputation methods, including mean, median, kNNI, MICE, SAITS, BRITS, MRNN, and Transformer, to scrutinize their impact on air quality data. The evaluation is conducted using diverse air quality datasets gathered from numerous cities globally. Based on these evaluations, we offer practical recommendations for practitioners dealing with missing data in time series scenarios for environmental data.},
