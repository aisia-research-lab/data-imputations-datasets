Most of the time, air quality data are time series data. However, due to various reasons, we often encounter missing values in datasets collected during data preparation and aggregation steps. The inability to analyze and handle missing data will significantly hinder the data analysis process. To address this issue, this paper offers an extensive review of air quality prediction and missing data imputation techniques for time series, particularly in relation to environmental challenges. In addition, we empirically assess eight imputation methods, including mean, median, kNNI, MICE, SAITS, BRITS, MRNN, and Transformer, to scrutinize their impact on air quality data. The evaluation is conducted using diverse air quality datasets gathered from numerous cities globally. Based on these evaluations, we offer practical recommendations for practitioners dealing with missing data in time series scenarios for environmental data.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement in healthcare data collection technologies and the importance of using multimodal data for accurate diagnosis leads to a surge in multimodal data characterized by different types, structures, and missing values. Machine learning algorithms for predicting or analyzing usually demand the completeness of data. As a result, handling missing data has become a critical concern in the healthcare sector. This survey paper comprehensively reviews recent works on handling multimodal missing data in healthcare. We emphasize methods for synthesizing data from various modalities or multiple sources in imputing missing data, including early fusion, late fusion, and intermediate fusion methods for missing data imputation. The main objective of this study is to identify gaps in the surveyed area and list future tasks and challenges in handling multimodal missing data in healthcare. This review is valuable for researchers and practitioners in healthcare data analysis. It provides insights into using fusion methods to improve data quality and healthcare outcomes.}

  abstract="The field of AI and machine learning is constantly evolving, and as the size of data continues to grow, so does the need for accurate and efficient methods of data processing. However, the data is not always perfect, and missing data is becoming common and occurs more frequently. Therefore, imputation techniques, aside from precision, needed to be scalable. For that reason, we examine the performance of Principle Components Analysis Imputation (PCAI) [9], an imputation speeding up framework, for logistic regression. Note that the coefficients of a logistic regression model are usually used for interpretation. Therefore, in addition to examining the improvement in the speed of PCAI, we examine how the coefficients of fitted logistic regression models change when using this imputation speeding-up mechanism. To demonstrate the efficiency of the mentioned method, the model's performance is compared against frequently used imputation methods on three popular datasets: Fashion MNIST, Gene, and Parkinson. And achieves lower time and better accuracy in most experiments.",

  abstract = {Parameter estimation is an important problem with applications in discriminant analysis, hypothesis testing, etc. Yet, when there are missing values in the data sets, commonly used imputation-based techniques are usually needed before further parameter estimation since works in direct parameter estimation exists in only limited settings. Unfortunately, such two-step procedures (imputation-parameter estimation) can be computationally expensive. Therefore, it motivates us to propose novel algorithms that directly find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for an arbitrary one-class/multiple-class randomly missing data set under some mild assumptions. Furthermore, due to the direct computation, our algorithms do not require multiple iterations through the data, thus promising to be less time-consuming while maintaining superior estimation performance than state-of-the-art methods under comparisons. We validate these claims by empirical results on various data sets of different sizes.}

  abstract = {The problem of monotone missing data has been broadly studied during the last two decades and has many applications in various fields such as bioinformatics or statistics. Commonly used imputation techniques require multiple iterations through the data before yielding convergence. Moreover, those approaches may introduce extra noises and biases to the subsequent modeling. In this work, we derive exact formulas and propose a novel algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of a multiple class, monotone missing dataset when all the covariance matrices of all categories are assumed to be equal, namely Efficient Parameter Estimation for Multiple Class Monotone Missing Data (EPEM). We then illustrate an application of our proposed methods in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). As the computation is exact, our EPEM algorithm does not require multiple iterations through the data as other imputation approaches, thus promising to handle much less time-consuming than other methods. This effectiveness was validated by empirical results when EPEM reduced the error rates significantly and required a short computation time compared to several imputation-based approaches. We also release all codes and data of our experiments in a GitHub repository to contribute to the research community related to this problem.}

This study aims to investigate the imputation techniques for sparse data using the Singular Value Decomposition technique, namely SVDI. We explore the application of the SVDI framework for image classification and text classification tasks that involve sparse data.
